# StreetSports Soccer Academy

StreetSports Soccer Academy is a voluntary organisation that specialise in coaching soccer skills to children between the ages of 7 to 12 years old.
Our aim is to improve the moral, social and physical welfare of the young people under our care, mainly through the promotion of football. The aim of the Academy is to pass on our love of football to young children and equip them for a healthy childhood where they can enjoy playing sports, fulfilling their potential to the maximum and developing important life skills. With this in mind, we see the website as an excellent opportunity to target parents with children in these age groups who have an interest in football and sport in general.

The main image below shows a group of kids playing football in a non competitve game which is what we want to promote.
