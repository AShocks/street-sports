                    We are a voluntary organisation run by fully qualified FAI coaches, all of whom are Garda vetted
                    and specialise in coaching soccer skills to children of our age group which is boys and girls
                    between the ages of 7 to 12 years old.

                    <p>
                    Our aim is to improve the moral, social and physical welfare of the young people under our care,
                     mainly through the promotion of football. While staying within this principle, the aim 
                     of the Academy is to pass on our love of football to young children and 
                     equip them for a healthy childhood where they can enjoy playing sports, fulfilling their potential 
                     to the maximum and developing important life skills. The coaches will encourage kids of all abilities 
                     to develop at their own pace in a fun environment.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                     One of the biggest resources required to run a successful club are committed volunteer coaches.
                      Often this role is fulfilled by parents and we welcome and encourage any parent who wants to become involved 
                      in coaching.
